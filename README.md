# Spectre+Prefetch 

This is the source code for our DAC paper "Spectre+Prefetch: Transmitting Secrets Through Modern Hardware Prefetchers in the Speculative World". We implemented Spectre+Prefetch in the gem5 simulator and the Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU.

After the paper is officially accepted, we will provide the polished code and detailed information on how to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
